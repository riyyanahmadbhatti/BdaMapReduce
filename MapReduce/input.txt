aristotles views dreams first idea sleep must examined aristotle gives account explanation sleep sleep wakefulness sleep takes place result overuse senses digestion vital body including senses revitalized person asleep critical activities include thinking sensing recalling remembering function wakefulness since person cannot sense sleep also desire result sensation however senses able work sleep albeit differently person awake sleep person still sensory experiences also senses inactive sleep ones weary theory dreams dreams involve actually sensing stimulus discussed senses work normally sleep dreams sensation still involved altered manner awake aristotle explains phenomenon occurs person stares moving stimulus waves body water look away stimulus next thing look appears moving wave like motion person perceives stimulus stimulus longer focus attention leaves impression body awake senses functioning properly person constantly encounters new stimuli sense impressions left previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however sleep impressions stimuli made throughout day become noticed new sensory experiences distract impressions made dreams result lasting impressions since impressions left exact stimuli dreams resemble actual experience occurred awake sleep person altered state mind aristotle compares sleeping person person overtaken strong feelings toward stimulus example person strong infatuation someone may begin think see person everywhere overtaken feelings person asleep senses acting awake results thinking like person influenced strong feelings since person sleeping suggestible state become easily deceived appears dreams asleep person unable make judgments awake due senses functioning normally sleep unable help person judge happening dream turn leads person believe dream real dreams may absurd nature senses able discern whether real dreamer left accept dream lack choice judge one component aristotles theory dreams introduces ideas contradictory previously held beliefs claimed dreams foretelling sent divine aristotle reasoned instances dreams resemble future events happenstances divinations ideas contradictory believed dreams time introduced ideas thinkers beginning give naturalistic opposed supernatural explanations phenomena aristotle also includes theory dreams constitutes dream claimed dream first established fact person asleep experience person image appear moment waking see something dark considered dream awake occurred secondly sensory experience actually occurs person asleep perceived person asleep qualify part dream example person sleeping door shuts dream hear door shut aristotle argues sensory experience part dream actual sensory experience perceived senses fact occurred person asleep make part dream
